# Splunk SIEM & Log Analysis Project ‚Äì Defensive Monitoring for VSI  

## üîç Project Overview  

This project focuses on building a real-time **log analysis and alerting system** for Virtual Space Industries (VSI), a company concerned about targeted cyberattacks from a competitor. Our team leveraged **Splunk** to ingest logs from **Windows servers** and **Apache web servers**, detect suspicious activity, and create dashboards, reports, and alerts to monitor system behavior.

We performed baseline analysis of normal activity and compared it with known attack logs, helping uncover brute-force attempts, unusual login spikes, account deletions, and international threat activity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Project Goals  

- Investigate normal and attack activity across Windows and Apache logs  
- Establish thresholds and build reports for login activity, account changes, HTTP methods, and response codes  
- Create visual dashboards to monitor and quickly identify threats  
- Generate and tune alerts to reduce false positives  
- Recommend security improvements based on findings

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Components  

- **Splunk SIEM** for log ingestion, search, alerting, and dashboards  
- **Apache Access Logs** for web activity monitoring  
- **Windows Security Logs** for system-level events  
- **IP Geolocation Add-on** to analyze foreign threat origins  
- **Normal & Attack Log Comparison** to identify threat patterns
